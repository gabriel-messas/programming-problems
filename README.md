# Programming Problems
Programming problems generally heavy on logic and low-level concepts

- For C files, simply compile using gcc (`gcc FILENAME`) and run the generated file
- For Python files, simply run using Python 3 (`python FILENAME`)
  - It might be necessary to install some libraries when the file has the `import` command on top. That can be done using `pip`, for instance, by running `pip install LIBRARY`
